### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp; I'm Nicholas Boucher

I've recently completed a PhD at the University of Cambridge. I also work for Microsoft.

### About me

Security is my primary interest ðŸ”‘, although machine learning is also pretty cool ðŸ§ . You can find my academic site [here](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ndb40), and my personal site [here](https://nicholas.bio).

I've pinned some of my favorite public projects below - enjoy!
